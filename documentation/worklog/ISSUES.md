# Current issues and limitations

No current routine-printing blocker is reported. The operator confirms printing, including slicing and transfer, works; [validation](TESTS.md) distinguishes that confirmation from observed checks.

| Area | Current limitation / handling |
|---|---|
| Chromebook audio | HiFi profiles are available in recorded checks, but speaker/headphone audibility and post-reboot audio function are unconfirmed. No new audio repair is justified by this absence of confirmation; retain the recovery material in operations |
| Physical usability and power | Touch/scaling, lid/idle and power-loss behavior need evaluation for the chosen kiosk setup. Device enumeration and masked sleep targets do not establish physical behavior |
| Kiosk mode | Planned for later. Account, interface, startup, lockdown and authentication choices remain open in [kiosk configuration](../kiosk/CONFIGURATION.md); current-user Studio persistence does not establish a kiosk session |

Network test coverage and administration/recovery evidence limits belong in [TESTS](TESTS.md). [Operations](../operations/OPERATIONS.md) provides supported access and diagnostic paths. No remaining system side effects are identified from this documentation-only task; live configuration, sessions and restricted backups are preserved. Resolved failures and superseded setup instructions remain in Git history.
